Javascript Scope Exercises
1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
x = 1;
    var a = 5;
    var b = 10;
    var c = function(a, b, c) {
      var x = 10;
      document.write(x);
      document.write(a);
      var f = function(a, b, c) {
          b = a;
          document.write(b);
          b = c;
          var x = 5;
        }
      f(a,b,c);
      document.write(b);
    }

    c(8,9,10);
    document.write(b);
    document.write(x);
    }

Print -- x -- 10
    Print -- a -- 8
    Print -- b -- 8
    Print -- b -- 10
    Print -- b -- 10
    Print -- x -- 1

2.What is the difference between a method and function?
A method is a function that belongs to a class. In JavaScript, however, a method is a function that belongs to an object.

3.What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
Inside an object's method, the object refers to itself as this.

4.What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
In JavaScript this always refers to the "owner" of the function we're executing, or rather, to the object that a function is a method of. When we define our faithful function doSomething() in a page, its owner is the page, or rather, the window object (or global object) of JavaScript.

5.What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.

    In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.

6.Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword this. When f is called by x.f( ), what does this refer to?
Refer to the prototype x

7.What is a free variable in JavaScript?
A variable referred to by a function that is not one of its parameters or local variables.

8.Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
var Student = {
      name: 'fred',
      major: 'music',
      foo: function(x, y) {
        if (x === y) {
          return 4 * x * x;
        } else {
          if (x < y>) {
            return x;
          } else {
            return y;
          }
        }
      }
    }

9.Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
function Employee(name, salary, position) {
      this.name = name;
      this.salary = salary;
      this.position = position;
    }

    var emp1 = new Employee('A', 4000, 'Developer');
    var emp2 = new Employee('B', 5000, 'DevOps');
    var emp3 = new Employee('C', 10000, 'Technical Architect');

10.Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the arguments.
function foo(...args) {
      if (args && args.length) {
        return args.reduce( (accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) =>
          accumulator * currentValue );
      }
      return 0;
    }

11.Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
var foo = (a, b, c) => {
      return Math.max(a, b, c);
    }
